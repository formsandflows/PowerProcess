# Power Process
**Power Process** is a generic and detailed model to automate processes using the Microsoft Power Platform. Because of its generic nature, many processes can be automated with Power Process.

Links to documentation pages can be found [here](https://www.formsandflows.nl/redirects/powerprocess-github-documentation).

If **Power Process** is useful to you, I would very much appreciate it if you bought me a coffee: [https://www.buymeacoffee.com/rickbakker](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/rickbakker) 👍

And with that, I wish you a lot of fun creating your business solutions with the Microsoft Power Platform and of course also with **Power Process** 😁👊
