# Power Process
**Power Process** is a generic and detailed model to automate processes using the Microsoft Power Platform. Because of its generic nature, many processes can be automated with Power Process.

If **Power Process** is useful to you, I would very much appreciate it if you bought me a coffee: [https://www.buymeacoffee.com/rickbakker](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/rickbakker) üëç

And with that, I wish you a lot of fun creating your business solutions with the Microsoft Power Platform and of course also with **Power Process** üòÅüëä
